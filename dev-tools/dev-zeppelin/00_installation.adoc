==== Custom Build (SNAPSHOT)
The goal is to build Zeppelin with *Spark-2.4*

NOTE: For this custome build *zeppelin-0.8.1-SNAPSHOT* was packaged.

Refer to https://zeppelin.apache.org/docs/latest/setup/basics/how_to_build.html[Build Zeppelin from Source]

======
WARNING: Zeppelin still doesn't support scala 2.12 and profile hadoop-3.1 doesn't exist! +
So this might work in the future one Zeppelin and Spark officialy support Scala-2.12

 $ mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pbuild-distr -Pspark-2.4 -Phadoop-3.1 -Pr -Pscala-2.12


======

. Clone the git repo:

 $ git clone https://github.com/apache/zeppelin.git

. Switch to the branch *branch-0.8*
. Run maven build with the following switches:

 $ mvn clean package -DskipTests -Pbuild-distr -Pspark-2.4 -Pscala-2.11

. This will build Zeppelin with Spark-2.4
